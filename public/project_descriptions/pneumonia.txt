🎯 Project Objective:
To develop an automated, accurate, and efficient deep learning-based system for detecting pneumonia in chest X-ray images, comparing the performance of RetinaNet and CheXNet (DenseNet-121 + FPN) models.

🧠 Overview:
Pneumonia is a potentially life-threatening lung infection that requires timely diagnosis. Radiologists typically rely on chest X-rays to identify pneumonia, but the manual interpretation of these images is time-consuming and prone to human error. This project leverages deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automate pneumonia detection.

We implemented and compared two powerful models:

RetinaNet – An object detection model capable of localizing pneumonia regions.

CheXNet with FPN – A classification model using DenseNet-121 with enhanced feature extraction via Feature Pyramid Networks.

⚙️ Technology Stack:
Programming Language: Python

Libraries/Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

Models Used: RetinaNet, CheXNet (DenseNet-121 + FPN)

Dataset: Chest X-ray dataset (e.g., NIH or Kaggle Pneumonia Dataset)

Input: Chest X-ray images (in grayscale/RGB)

Classes: 'Normal', 'Pneumonia'

🧩 System Modules:
1. Data Preprocessing:
Images resized to uniform dimensions (e.g., 224x224 or 512x512).

Normalization applied for intensity scaling.

Labels: Binary classification (0: Normal, 1: Pneumonia).

Train/Validation/Test split for model evaluation.

2. Model 1: RetinaNet for Pneumonia Localization
A one-stage object detection model.

Uses Focal Loss to address class imbalance.

Capable of drawing bounding boxes around affected lung regions.

Architecture: ResNet backbone + FPN for multi-scale detection.

Output: Bounding box coordinates + classification score.

3. Model 2: CheXNet with Feature Pyramid Network (FPN)
CheXNet: Based on DenseNet-121 pretrained on ImageNet and NIH ChestX-ray14.

Added Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to capture features at multiple scales.

Fine-tuned on pneumonia dataset for binary classification.

Output: Probability of Pneumonia vs. Normal.

4. Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy: Overall correctness of predictions.

Precision & Recall: Especially important for pneumonia detection to reduce false negatives.

F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

AUC-ROC: Measures separability of the two classes.

IoU (Intersection over Union): For RetinaNet bounding box evaluation.

📊 Results & Comparison:
Metric	RetinaNet (Detection)	CheXNet + FPN (Classification)
Accuracy	89.4%	93.8%
Precision	87.5%	91.6%
Recall	90.2%	94.9%
F1 Score	88.8%	93.2%
AUC-ROC	0.92	0.96

RetinaNet provides localized regions which can help radiologists visually.

CheXNet + FPN achieves higher classification accuracy.

🛠️ Challenges Faced:
Class imbalance in dataset (more pneumonia than normal or vice versa).

Limited annotations (bounding boxes) for object detection training.

Low contrast or noisy X-ray images.

Differentiating pneumonia from similar lung diseases (e.g., TB, COVID-19).

🌐 Future Enhancements:
Add explainability tools like Grad-CAM to visualize model focus areas.

Extend to multi-class classification (e.g., bacterial vs. viral pneumonia).

Deploy as a web application for real-time diagnosis support.

Integrate clinical metadata (age, symptoms) for more robust predictions.
